## [2.1.12] - 2024-08-14
### Fixed

- Improved integration with Plater's border color system for more consistent behavior
- Border colors now correctly revert without requiring opening the Plater UI

## [2.1.11] - 2024-08-13
### Fixed
- Resolved issue where ESC key would close DotMaster window AND open the game menu; ESC now only closes the DM window if it's open, requiring a second press to open the game menu.
- Changed GUI auto-close trigger from general zone changes to `LOADING_SCREEN_ENABLED` event, so it only closes during actual loading screens (e.g., entering instances, teleporting).
- Addressed an `ADDON_ACTION_BLOCKED` error related to `SetPropagateKeyboardInput` by removing the problematic `HookScript`. The primary `SetPropagateKeyboardInput(true)` and `OnKeyDown` for ESCAPE should maintain desired behavior.

- Removed the 'B' key functionality for closing the DotMaster window to simplify keybindings.

-- This is a placeholder. The file should be replaced with an actual TGA image file.
-- Since we can't create a binary TGA file directly here, you'll need to create a small
-- colored square image and convert it to TGA format, then place it in this location.

-- Example dimensions: 32x32 pixels
-- Color: Purple to match the addon's theme (#CC00FF)

-- If you don't replace this file, the minimap button will use a default texture
-- To create an icon, you can use an image editor like GIMP or Photoshop and save as TGA

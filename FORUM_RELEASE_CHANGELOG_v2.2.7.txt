=== DotMaster v2.2.8 - Minimap Icon Toggle Reliability ===

Release Date: August 17, 2025
WoW Compatibility: 11.1.7 and 11.2.0

What’s New:
- Fixed minimap icon toggle so it reliably shows/hides from both the General tab and `/dm minimap`
- Removed duplicate `/dm` registrations that caused repeated chat messages
- Centralized initialization to prevent conflicts and delayed re-initialization
- Preserved LibDBIcon’s internal reference by updating saved variables in-place

Technical Notes:
- Toggle now reads from `DotMasterDB.minimap.hide`
- Settings save updates `DotMasterDB.minimap` fields without replacing the table
- `DM.LDBIcon` reference is set during initialization for reuse

Download v2.2.8 today and enjoy a more reliable minimap toggle!

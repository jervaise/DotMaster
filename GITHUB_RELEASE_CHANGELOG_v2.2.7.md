## üí° What This Fixes

**Before v2.2.7:** Tank players would see "lost threat" red colors on mobs that another tank was legitimately tanking in raids, causing confusion and unnecessary concern.

**After v2.2.7:** The addon intelligently detects when other tanks in your raid are handling specific mobs and doesn't show false threat warnings, while still alerting you when you actually lose threat to DPS or when no tank has aggro.

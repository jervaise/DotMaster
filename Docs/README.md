## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized to provide both high-level overviews and detailed technical information. The Developer Guide is the primary reference for anyone working on the project, while specialized guides provide additional information on specific topics.

## Development Process

DotMaster follows a structured development process:

1. Make small, incremental changes
2. Test thoroughly with debug messages
3. Verify with in-game testing
4. Document all changes
5. Update version numbers

See the [Developer Guide](DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) for a complete description of the development process.

## Debug System

The DotMaster debug system is a critical development tool. It provides:

- Category-based message filtering
- Detailed debug console
- Specialized debug functions for different parts of the codebase
- Persistent logging across sessions

See the [Debug System](DEBUG_SYSTEM.md) guide for detailed information on using this system.

## Current Development Focus

- Validating the v0.5.0 restoration for stability and functionality
- Testing the restoration in various combat scenarios
- Planning for careful re-implementation of critical API updates
- Maintaining documentation accuracy

## Known Issues

1. **API Compatibility**: The restoration to v0.4.0 code means some critical API updates are pending re-implementation
2. **Performance**: May experience frame drops during combat with many targets
3. **Nameplate Detection**: Occasional issues detecting all nameplates in crowded scenarios

## Next Development Steps

1. Complete in-game testing of the restored codebase
2. Carefully re-implement critical API updates from v0.4.2
3. Optimize performance through code profiling and enhancement
4. Test profile functionality across multiple characters
5. Verify compatibility with other popular addon UI frameworks

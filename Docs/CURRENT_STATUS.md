## Current Development Focus

- Validating the v0.5.0 restoration for stability and functionality
- Testing the restoration in various combat scenarios
- Planning for careful re-implementation of critical API updates
- Maintaining documentation accuracy

## Known Issues

1. **API Compatibility**: The restoration to v0.4.0 code means some critical API updates are pending re-implementation
2. **Performance**: May experience frame drops during combat with many targets
3. **Nameplate Detection**: Occasional issues detecting all nameplates in crowded scenarios
4. **Visual Consistency**: DoT indicators may misalign when nameplate size changes dynamically

## Next Development Steps

1. Complete in-game testing of the restored codebase
2. Carefully re-implement critical API updates from v0.4.2
3. Optimize performance through code profiling and enhancement
4. Test profile functionality across multiple characters
5. Verify compatibility with other popular addon UI frameworks
6. Create comprehensive documentation for end users

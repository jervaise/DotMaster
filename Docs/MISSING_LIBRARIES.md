## Original Installation Instructions (For Reference)

### Option 1: Download from GitHub

1. **LibDataBroker-1.1**:
   - Download from: https://github.com/tekkub/libdatabroker-1-1

### Option 2: Extract from another Ace3 addon

Many addons include these libraries. You can find one with these libraries and copy them:

1. Check your other addons in: `World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns\`
2. Look for addons that use Ace3 (like DBM, WeakAuras, etc.)
3. Copy the `LibDataBroker-1.1` and `LibDBIcon-1.0` folders from their `Libs` directory

### Option 3: Download Ace3 Complete Package

1. Go to: https://www.wowace.com/projects/ace3
2. Download the latest release
3. Extract and copy the `LibDataBroker-1.1` and `LibDBIcon-1.0` folders to your `Libs` directory

## Verification

✅ The libraries have been installed and the `embeds.xml` file has been updated to include them.

The minimap button functionality should now work correctly when the addon is loaded in the game.

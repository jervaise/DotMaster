This document tracks current known issues in DotMaster and provides workarounds where available.

## API Compatibility Issues

### âœ… GetSpellInfo() Deprecation (FIXED in v0.4.2)

## Performance Issues

## Feature Limitations

### Find My Dots Range Limitations

## UI Issues

### Settings Panel Scale

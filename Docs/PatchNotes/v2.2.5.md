# DotMaster v2.2.5 Patch Notes
**Release Date:** January 27, 2025

## üõ†Ô∏è Fixed Issues

### Force Threat Color for Tanks - Multi-Tank Raid Support

The Force Threat Color feature has been significantly improved to properly handle multi-tank raid environments. This was a critical issue where tanks would incorrectly see "no aggro" colors on mobs that were being legitimately tanked by other tanks in the raid.

#### What Was Fixed:
- **Incorrect "No Aggro" Colors**: Tanks no longer receive false "no aggro" warnings when another tank is properly tanking a mob
- **Raid Environment Detection**: Added proper detection for raid vs non-raid environments
- **DoT Coloring Interference**: Fixed early return statements that were preventing DoT coloring from working
- **Combat State Validation**: Enhanced checks for player combat, unit combat, and PVP situations

#### How It Works Now:
1. **In Raids**: System checks if any tank in the raid is tanking the mob before applying "no aggro" colors
2. **Outside Raids**: Uses original logic (dungeons, solo content typically have one tank)
3. **DoT Colors**: Always processes DoT coloring regardless of threat detection results
4. **Combat Awareness**: Only processes threat when all conditions are met (in combat, non-PVP, etc.)

## üîß Technical Improvements

### Enhanced Threat Detection Logic
- Restructured to match Plater's recommended best practices
- Uses `Plater.ZoneInstanceType == "raid"` for environment detection
- Leverages `Plater.GetTanks()` for tank list and `UnitName(unitFrame.targetUnitID)` for target detection
- Improved code flow to ensure DoT coloring always executes after threat checks

### Combat State Validation
- Added proper checks for `Plater.IsInCombat()`
- Validates unit combat state with `unitFrame.InCombat`
- Automatically disables in PVP using `UnitPlayerControlled(unitId)`

### Code Quality
- Eliminated early return statements that blocked DoT functionality
- Consolidated threat logic into single conditional blocks
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing configurations

## üìã Migration Notes

This update is fully backward compatible. No configuration changes are required. The improvements will automatically take effect for users with Force Threat Color enabled.

## üéØ Impact

This fix primarily benefits:
- **Raid Tanks**: No more false "no aggro" warnings during tank swaps or multi-tank encounters
- **Multi-Tank Groups**: Proper coordination between tank threat indicators
- **All Users**: Ensures DoT coloring works reliably in all scenarios

## üîÑ Validation

The fix has been validated against the reference Plater script and follows established best practices for threat detection in multi-tank environments.

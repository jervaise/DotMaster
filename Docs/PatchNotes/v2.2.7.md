# DotMaster v2.2.8 - Minimap Icon Toggle Reliability

## Overview
This release addresses an issue where the minimap icon did not properly show/hide when toggled from the UI or via the `/dm minimap` command.

## Fixes
- Minimap icon visibility now correctly reflects the state across reloads and login
- Unified the source of truth for visibility to `DotMasterDB.minimap.hide`
- Removed duplicate slash command registrations that caused double messages
- Eliminated delayed/redundant initialization hooks that re-registered handlers

## Technical Details
- `DM:ToggleMinimapIcon()` reads the hide state from saved variables (fallback to API settings)
- `DM.API:SaveSettings()` updates `DotMasterDB.minimap` fields in-place to preserve LibDBIconâ€™s reference
- The `DM.LDBIcon` reference is assigned at initialization for consistent access

## Compatibility
- WoW 11.1.7 and 11.2.0

## Notes
No configuration changes are required. Toggle works immediately via the General tab or `/dm minimap` and persists properly.

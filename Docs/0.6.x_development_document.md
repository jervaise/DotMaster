# DotMaster Version 0.6.x Development Document

## Original User Prompts (Beginning of 0.6.x Development)

> "I want to integrate GUI elements with the database logic for the DotMaster project, specifically the `dmspellsdb`. I have added a Database tab to the GUI and need to implement functionalities for database interaction. I need a structured plan for the next steps, including defining the database structure, implementing button functionalities, and testing interactions. It's important to verify changes in the game using in-addon debugger messages."

> "I have not yet implemented database persistence and proper database integration for the project, indicating that I am making progress in that area."

> "I need to ensure that settings are not saved during the recording process. A dedicated 'Save to Database' button in the post-record dialogue should be used instead of auto-saving."

> "I need to mark the project with a version increment, specifically noting a fix for the 'Find My Dots' GUI and the removal of auto-save functionality. This should be easily retrievable for future reference."

> "I need to add debug messages to ensure that the 'Find My Dots' feature provides the correct spell data after the recording session. Also, the nameplate debugger section should load unchecked by default."

> "I need to check if the data brought by the record is correctly formed and if the data is correctly saved, with incomplete fields filled with defaults."

> "I am having issues with spell icons not being correctly retrieved. Need to implement proper spell icon retrieval."

> "I want one single db from now on called dmspellsdb. There is no data in the old databases so we don't need migration, we just need to do this transition very carefully without breaking the code."

> "I want the new db to be in this structure:
> - dmspells
> - spellid
> - spellname
> - spell icon
> - wow class the spell belongs to (like priest, warrior etc.)
> - wow spec the spell belongs to (like shadow, unholy, protection etc)
> - color - the color used for coloring the nameplates, default is red
> - priority - used to order spells in the tracked spells window
> - tracked - whether to be shown in the tracked spells window 1/0
> - enabled - whether to be used for coloring the nameplates 1/0"

> "Here's the flow I imagine:
> - When a spell is found by find my dots, the spell details are displayed in a list in the post recording dialogue
> - There is a save to database button underneath, when clicked the spells are saved to the database
> - Any missing info such as color, priority, tracked and enabled are marked with defaults. By default it's red, highest priority, tracked yes and enabled yes
> - Spell IDs already in the database won't be shown as found, both in the popup during recording window and in the dialogue after recording. Nor will they be saved as a duplicate. Only new spells will be alerted, shown and saved
> - Spells in the database will be listed in the database tab. They will be able to be added or removed from tracking from this interface
> - The spells will be correctly structured by class and spec
> - The tracked spells tab will display spells that are tracked only
> - It will be possible to enable spells for coloring here with a checkbox
> - Spells will also be removed from tracking with a remove button, effectively marking them with tracked 0
> - The spells will be displayed with class structure only, but they will be listed in order within the spell data. It will be able to be sort them with arrows, as already implemented in the spell tracking tab to change priority
> - The tracked spells tab will continue to use the colorpicker already implemented to manipulate the color field in the database for the spell
> - Both database and tracked spells tabs will contain a button for find my dots
> - Tracked spells will have an add from database button that opens database tab if there are any spells in it, or not be clickable
> - Database tab will have a reset database button with a confirmation warning popup
> - The spelldata will be saved when clicked 'add to database' in the post recording dialogue, when color is changed, when order is changed, when added to tracking, when removed from tracking
> - The database must persist between sessions, by recording the necessary data to the saved variables document"

> "I want to be able to ingame test every step we do. For that you need to understand the current debug system and make sure the addon doesn't lose the ability to load in game, so we can detect any issues. Start with the simplest steps, such as creating new gui tabs and buttons to see if they work. Slowly work towards database changes. Tiny steps."

## Overview
This document provides a detailed account of the development process for version 0.6.x of the DotMaster addon, focusing on implementing a new unified database structure.

## Project Goals
- Design a robust database structure called `dmspellsdb`.
- Integrate the database with existing and new GUI elements.
- Implement persistence using WoW's saved variables.
- Modify features to utilize the new database.
- Conduct thorough testing and debugging.

## New Database Structure
### `dmspellsdb`: The main table for storing spell data with the following fields
- **spellid**: Unique identifier for each spell.
- **spellname**: Name of the spell.
- **spellicon**: Icon associated with the spell.
- **wowclass**: The World of Warcraft class the spell belongs to (e.g., Priest, Warrior).
- **wowspec**: The specialization within the class (e.g., Shadow, Unholy).
- **color**: The color used for nameplate coloring, defaulting to red.
- **priority**: Determines the order of spells in the tracked spells window.
- **tracked**: Indicates if the spell should be shown in the tracked spells window (1 for yes, 0 for no).
- **enabled**: Indicates if the spell should be used for coloring nameplates (1 for yes, 0 for no).

## Workflow and Features

### Spell Detection and Recording:
- When a spell is detected by "Find My Dots," it is displayed in a list.
- A "Save to Database" button allows users to save new spells to the database.
- Default values are assigned for missing information: color (red), priority (highest), tracked (yes), and enabled (yes).
- Duplicate spell IDs are not shown or saved again.

### Database Management:
- Spells are listed in the database tab, allowing users to add or remove them from tracking.
- Spells are organized by class and spec.
- The tracked spells tab displays only tracked spells and allows enabling/disabling coloring via a checkbox.
- Spells can be removed from tracking, setting tracked to 0.
- Spells are displayed by class and ordered by priority, with sorting options available.
- The color picker in the tracked spells tab allows users to change the color field in the database.

### User Interface Enhancements:
- Both the database and tracked spells tabs have a "Find My Dots" button.
- The tracked spells tab includes an "Add from Database" button to open the database tab.
- The database tab has a "Reset Database" button with a confirmation warning.

### Persistence:
- The database must persist between sessions by saving data to the saved variables document.
- Changes are saved when spells are added to the database, colors are changed, orders are changed, and tracking status is modified.

  - Added debug messages to track icon retrieval
  - Implemented fallback handling for cases where icon retrieval fails
- **Status**: Completed
- **Notes**: This was a challenging issue that required multiple attempts to resolve

### [Current Date] - Investigating Missing Icon ID (Spell 589)
- **Prompt**: User tested Spell ID 589, result was `Icon ID: nil`.
- **Task**: Determine why `C_Spell.GetSpellInfo(589)` returns a nil icon ID.
- **Steps**:
  - Confirmed API returns nil for Icon ID 589.
  - Hypothesized that the actual spell ID detected might differ from 589 or that the API has limitations.
  - Added a debug message to `RecordDots` in `find_my_dots.lua` to print the exact spell ID captured from the `UNIT_AURA` event.
- **Status**: Waiting for user to test with the new debug message.

### [Current Date] - Clarification on Spell ID Testing
- **Prompt**: User corrected assistant's implication about "random" IDs; ID 589 is known for Shadow Word: Pain.
- **Task**: Clarify the reasoning for testing the specific spell ID detected by the `UNIT_AURA` event, even if a common ID is known.
- **Steps**:
  - Apologized for the poor phrasing.
  - Explained that WoW events might trigger different spell IDs (ranks, talents, etc.) than commonly listed ones.
  - Re-emphasized the need to check the ID captured by the added debug message in `RecordDots` to confirm what the addon is actually detecting.
- **Status**: Waiting for user to test with the debug message.

### [Current Date] - Console-Based Icon Retrieval Testing (GetSpellTexture)
- **Prompt**: User clarified the desire to find a working icon retrieval method via console commands *before* modifying the addon.
- **Task**: Provide alternative console commands to test different API functions for retrieving spell icons.
- **Steps**:
  - Acknowledged the user's preferred strategy (console-first testing).
  - Proposed testing the older `GetSpellTexture(spellID)` API function.
  - Provided the `/run` command to test `GetSpellTexture(589)`.
- **Status**: Waiting for user testing results for `GetSpellTexture`.

### [Current Date] - Console-Based Icon Retrieval Testing (Spellbook Search)
- **Prompt**: Previous command (`GetSpellTexture`) didn't work. User wants continued console-based testing.
- **Task**: Attempt to find the spell icon by searching the player's spellbook for the spell name.
- **Steps**:
  - Inquired about how the previous command failed.
  - Proposed searching the spellbook using `C_SpellBook.GetAllSpellIDs()` and checking `C_Spell.GetSpellInfo` for each matching spell name ("Shadow Word: Pain").
  - Provided the `/run` command to perform the spellbook search and print the results (found ID/Icon ID, found but invalid icon, or not found).
- **Status**: Waiting for user testing results for the spellbook search command.

### [Current Date] - Console-Based Icon Retrieval Testing (Simplified Approach)
- **Prompt**: Console commands provided so far don't return any values.
- **Task**: Test with much simpler commands to verify basic API functionality in console.
- **Steps**:
  - Provided a very basic command using the older `GetSpellInfo` function to check the first 5 spells in the spellbook.
  - Provided a second command for checking specific tab/slot positions in the spellbook.
  - Noted that successful execution of these commands would provide a basis for further testing.
- **Status**: Waiting for user testing results for the simplified commands.

### [Current Date] - Direct Addon Code Modification Approach
- **Prompt**: User noted the commands aren't working as in-game chat commands.
- **Task**: Abandon console-based testing in favor of directly implementing a better icon retrieval system in the addon code.
- **Steps**:
  - Proposed implementing a fallback sequence in the addon code that tries multiple WoW API functions:
    1. `C_Spell.GetSpellInfo(id).iconFileID` (current method)
    2. `GetSpellTexture(id)`
    3. `select(3, GetSpellInfo(id))`
    4. Default to question mark icon if all methods fail
  - This approach maximizes the chance of retrieving a valid icon regardless of which API method works for a particular spell.
- **Status**: Preparing to implement the fallback sequence in the addon code.

### [Current Date] - Implementation of Robust Icon Retrieval System
- **Prompt**: Created a solution to retrieve correct spell icons.
- **Task**: Implement the fallback sequence for spell icon retrieval in the addon code.
- **Steps**:
  - Created a new helper function `DM:GetSpellIcon(spellID)` in `find_my_dots.lua`.
  - Implemented a sequential fallback mechanism that tries:
    1. `C_Spell.GetSpellInfo(spellID).iconFileID` (modern API)
    2. `GetSpellTexture(spellID)` (traditional texture retrieval)
    3. `select(3, GetSpellInfo(spellID))` (classic method)
    4. Default question mark icon as final fallback
  - Added debug messages at each stage to identify which method succeeds.
  - Updated all three icon retrieval locations in `find_my_dots.lua` to use the new helper function.
- **Status**: Ready for testing.
- **Action Required**: User should test the addon with the new icon retrieval system and verify that spell icons display correctly.

### [Current Date] - Fix for Missing GetSpellTexture Function
- **Prompt**: User reported error: "attempt to call global 'GetSpellTexture' (a nil value)" with debug details.
- **Task**: Fix the `GetSpellIcon` function to handle the missing API call and use available icon fields.
- **Steps**:
  - Analyzed error message and locals dump, which revealed `GetSpellTexture` doesn't exist in current WoW API.
  - Discovered that `C_Spell.GetSpellInfo` actually returns `iconID` and `originalIconID` fields for spell 589.
  - Updated `GetSpellIcon` function to:
    - Remove the call to non-existent `GetSpellTexture` function
    - Check for `iconID` and `originalIconID` fields in addition to `iconFileID`
    - Keep the classic `GetSpellInfo` fallback as a secondary method
- **Status**: Ready for testing.

### [Current Date] - Successful Icon Retrieval Implementation and Version Increment
- **Prompt**: "yes icon retrieval works. success, increment"
- **Task**: Update version numbers to reflect the successful implementation of the spell icon retrieval system.
- **Steps**:
  - Received confirmation that the icon retrieval system works correctly.
  - Updated version number from 0.5.3 to 0.6.4 in both README.md and DotMaster.toc files.
  - Note: The robust icon retrieval system now properly handles different icon field formats in the spell data returned by C_Spell.GetSpellInfo.
- **Status**: Completed. Version 0.6.4 now has proper icon handling in the "Find My Dots" feature.

### [Current Date] - Database Tab Implementation
- **Prompt**: "next step is to make sure the database tab displays the spells in the database correctly"
- **Task**: Implement the Database tab functionality to correctly display spells from the `dmspellsdb`.
- **Steps**:
  - Modified `gui_database_tab.lua` to use `dmspellsdb` instead of `spellDatabase`.
  - Updated the fields used (`wowclass` instead of `class`, `wowspec` instead of `spec`, `spellname` instead of `name`, etc.).
  - Added "Find My Dots" and "Reset Database" buttons to the tab with proper functionality.
  - Enhanced visual display with class colors for better readability.
